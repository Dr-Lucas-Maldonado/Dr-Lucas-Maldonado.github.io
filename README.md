## üß¨ Summary
I am a bioinformatics scientist with extensive expertise in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, and multi-omics integration. With 15+ years of experience in bioinformatics R&D across academic and private sectors, I have led high-impact projects in single-cell genomics, functional transcriptomics, and precision medicine. Beyond leadership, I am deeply involved in the development of computational algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines, ensuring scalable, reproducible, and high-performance solutions for analysing complex transcriptomic datasets. I specialize in single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analysis, genomics, and multi-omics approaches, including the integration of transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, and proteomics. 
My ability combines both, leadership with deep technical expertise. I thrive under pressure, seamlessly integrating responsibility, enthusiasm, strategic thinking, and meticulous attention to detail while leveraging agile methodologies to drive impactful results. This approach, combined with my extensive experience in both wet lab and in silico research, as well as strong leadership skills, allows me to deliver high-value contributions in any professional setting.
My expertise includes:
- **Single-Cell Transcriptomics** (scRNA-seq, CITE-seq, ATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics)
- **Bulk RNA-seq** and differential expression analysis
- **Multi-Omics Data Integration** (genomics, proteomics, and epigenomics)
- **Variant Analysis & Functional Genomics**
- **Development of Scalable Pipelines & HPC for Omics Data Processing**
